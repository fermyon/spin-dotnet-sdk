# Spin .NET PostgreSQL sample

This directory contains a work-in-progress sample of building a database-backed
application using Spin and PostgreSQL.

If you want to run this sample, you'll need to:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database using the tables in the `sql` directory.
1. Set the `SPIN_CONFIG_PG_CONN_STR` environment variable to the connection string for the database.
   The connection string is in space-separated format e.g. `user=foo password=bar dbname=test host=127.0.0.1`

We will provide more detailed information in a subsequent update. In the
meantime, if you run into problems, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-dotnet-sdk/issues)
or [contact us on Discord](https://discord.gg/AAFNfS7NGf).
